# final_state_population

## Basic Idea:
The masses and spins of two inspiraling and merging black holes
determines the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant
black hole.  Therefore, knowing the mass and spin distribution
of the inspiraling bodies means knowing the distribution of
the final state mass and spin and kick velocity.  This 
can be straightforwardly calculated from the hyperparameter posterior
samples from the LVC.  One could also use the rate to determine
the mass spectrum (and total number) of remnant black holes today.
